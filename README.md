### Technologies Used

- HTML & CSS 
- Javascript
- APIs
- Jquery & Json
- Ruby
- Sinatra
- Active Record
- Heroku

-------------------------------------

### Approach
1. We designed the website from wireframe.
2. Created Team Git Repository, designated a gitlord and continously pushed to master and pulled remote Master to local.
3. Defined and created database tables using Postgresql.
4. Created routes inside Sinatra framework.
5. Created Models, Active Records and each pages on website.
6. Continuously amended tables in database.
7. Got data from New York Times APIs and Local APIs.
8. Using the API's JSON data, dynamically created articles in Javascript. 
9. Everytime team member has been finished their task, keep committing it 
10. Continuously test bugs. If bugs happened, we fixed the bugs.
11. When person's task has been completed, person piggybacks onto team member's current task or sets out to do a new task.
12. Continuously pushing and pulling.
13. Open communication at all times - locally or remotely.

### User Stories
People who are seeking for a unique birthday present for their close family or friends or curious about what happened on their birthday since they were born until now.

The app was created by having a curiosity of knowing which pieces of history were taking place when we turn one year older, so we have a niche audience.

They are able to see the articles and filter the articles according to the categories given. We provided a feature of bookmark as well if they want to store specific articles in a folder. 
If they search manually to check with somebody else's birthday, they can save the articles in a folder and they can give a name for the folder.

--------------------------------------

#### Difficult Obstacles
1. Wrapping our heads about sharing and merging from a remote repo.
2. Transitioning from singular vision to collaborating while sharing and updating our code.
3. Infrequently fell into the trap of having 2 team members doing teh same task - making for conflicting merging.
4. Creating and appending css modules dynamically in each article list page.
5. Delayed ajax request interferes workflow.
6. Locating and ignoring outdated and incomplete json data from NewYorkTimes API.

#### Unsolved Problems
1. Making the functionality to delete bookmarks.
2. Did not manage to make the home and about icon smoothly trasnsition to the words.
3. Alignment of banner icons is off when shrtinking the browser window.
